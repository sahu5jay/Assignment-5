In contrast, file.readline() reads the file one line at a time, which is more memory-efficient for large files. Both methods include newline characters (\\n) in their output. The key difference is that read() loads the whole file, while readline() allows sequential line-by-line reading, making it better for processing large files safely."

Python can also face memory leaks due to unintentional references or growing data structures. Although the garbage collector handles circular references, it may not clean them up immediately, causing delays. Additionally, Python's high-level data types use more memory, and developers have limited manual control over memory allocation, which can be a drawback in performance-critical applications."
